**Step 1:**

Install one of the listed RASPBIAN operating system versions from below: 

1) **Raspbian Stretch with desktop version 2018-11-13 or later**

   _install.sh_ script uses the mainline kernel driver sources with only a few source code patches, see _install.sh_ for more details. Our performance optimizations of the CAN, UART and SPI drivers are currently not included in these mainline drivers.
